Repository for saving code and file that are needed for exporting a Azure DevOps wiki to a single document (PDF, DOCX))

This repository cotains all the code for setting up a Azure Pipeline that generates a file (docx, pdf) of the existing wiki wihtin the project. For the generation we make use of a product called: [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
